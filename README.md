PROJECT IDEA


1. ITS A CONTROLLED ANIMATION OF CIRCLES (MORE LOOKS LIKE A 2-D BALL).
2.I MADE IT USING CANVAS,JS,HTML,CSS.



PROJECT FEATURES:::

 

O.WE CAN SHOW  PROPER ELASTIC COLLISONS !!! ,A SIMULATION HELP IN PHYSICS.

1.WE CAN CONTROLL COLORS OF BALLS IN ANIMATION (FROM RANDOM TO STATIC).

2.WE CAN INCREASE OR DECREASE NO. OF CIRCLES  IN ANIMATION.( CAN HELP IN ANALIZING MOTION OF SINGLE ATOMS AND THOUSANDS AT SAME TIME). 

3.ALSO WE CAN CONTROLL SPEED MANUALLY ,MAKING THE ANIMATION MORE COOL AS PER DEMAND.


************IT CAN BE USED IN SIMULATION OF processes,such as KTG (IN SHOWING MOVEMENT OF ATOMS AND THEIR RANDOM MOTION)***************

************IT CAN ALSO BE USED MAKING ANIMATION FOR WEBPAGES BACKGROUND ,LIKE THAT I SAW IN "CEREBRO" WEBSITE**************************

************MANY DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS , SUCH AS SOUND VISUALISERS,2-D MODELLING,2-D GAMES,2-D SIMULATIONS ARE POSSIBLE WITH THIS****** 

FUTURE EXPECTATIONS
1.CURRENTLY WORKING ON COOL AUDIO VISUALISER USING WEB AUDIO API, IT IS ALMOST COMPLETEDI ONLY NEED TO ASSEMBLE THEM ,I WISH I WOULD HAVE UPLOADED IT IN MAKERS.
